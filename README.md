# Art-potrait
Art by GAN
This project demonstrates the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate artistic portraits. GANs are a type of deep learning architecture that consists of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that are trained in an adversarial manner. The generator tries to generate realistic images, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated images.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Art Portraits dataset from Kaggle, which consists of a collection of portrait paintings.
Requirements

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
PIL (Python Imaging Library)
The notebook contains the following sections:

Importing required libraries
Loading and preprocessing the dataset
Building the Generator model
Building the Discriminator model
Defining the GAN model
Training the GAN
Generating new portraits using the trained GAN

Results
The trained GAN model can generate artistic portraits that resemble the style of the training data. Some examples of generated portraits are displayed in the notebook.
